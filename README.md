This is video streaming app, which was written for streaming video from
Raspberry Pi to client machine. For this I have prepared 3 programs for
comparison in C++, Python and quick commands in bash.

C++ Explanation:

Python Explanation:

Bash Explanation:

Observations:
Since I used only Python for streaming data, I have seen that this app
sometimes losses data. For checking this up I have written scripts in bash.
My charger has low voltage to make RPi run correctly. Also the delay was
between 5 - 8 seconds.
